			<h1>My Favorite Programming Application, jGRASP</h1>
			<h2>Using jGRASP to Create, Compile, and Run a Java Program</h2>
			<p>jGRASP is an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes a text editor, compiler, 
			debugger, and other utilities useful for creating programs.</p>  
			<p>To use jGRASP you must have both jGRASP and the Sun JDK (Java Development Kit) installed 
			on your computer.</p>
			<p>To check if the JDK is already on your computer go to the folder called Program Files on your 
			hard drive, probably it is the drive C:.  In this folder check if you have a folder named Java with 
			a folder named jdk 1.5 or 1.6 with some version number following.  Just the jre (Java Runtime 
			Environment) is not sufficient. </p>
			<p>If you don’t have this or would like to get the most recent version you can download it 
			<a href=":http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp"> here</a>.</p>
			<p>You can download the most recent version of jGRASP 
			<a href=":http://www.jgrasp.org/"> here</a>.</p>
			<h2>Creating a Java Source Code File Using the jGRASP Text Editior</h2>
			<p>Launch the jGRASP Application </p>
			<p>Choose start -> All Programs -> jGRASP or double click the desktop shortcut if one was 
			created. </p>
			<p>Choose File -> New -> Java from the pull down menu along the top of the jGRASP window.  
			This will open a text editor window in the top right portion of the computer screen.  Type the 
			source code for your Java program in this window. </p>
			<p>After you have finished entering your source code save your file by choosing File -> Save from 
			the pull down menu along the top of the screen.</p>
			<h2>Compiling a Simple Java Program Using jGRASP</h2>
			<p>Choose Build -> Compile from the pull down menu at the top of the screen to compile your 
			program. </p>
			<p>If the compiler finds syntax errors in your source file, it will display error messages in the 
			Compile Messages window/box at the bottom of the screen.  You must edit your source code 
			making the necessary corrections, then resave, and recompile.  Repeat this process until you get a 
			message indicating that the compile operation is complete.  </p>
			<h2>Running a Simple Java Program in the jGRASP IDE</h2>
			<p>To execute or run the byte code for your Java program choose Build -> Run from the pull down 
			menu at the top of the screen.  The screen output of your program, if there is any, will be 
			displayed in the Run I/O window/box at the bottom of the screen.</p>
